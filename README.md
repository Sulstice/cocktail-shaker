cocktail-shaker is a **high-performance drug enumeration and expansion
library**. cocktail-shaker leverages the computational power of
**RDKit** to create and enumerate large volumes of drug compounds. 

Announcements
=============

-   Work has began! March 2020

Using Megladon
=====================

Megladon will be my starcraft 2 ai that will be publically avaliable for people to use freely in building their AI. As the project evolves and the megladon gains more power and success certain features of the bot will be non-disclosed (I expect it to go pro - high expectations for my bot). 

Megladon's goals:

- Become a grandmaster of the protoss race

Installation 
============

Megladon will be running primarily with python 3.5+. As for now if you want to submit any PRs then please clone/fork this repository and follow the contribution guidelines. 

The project will be under heavy development as I find the time to code it (response may be slow). 

    git clone https://github.com/Sulstice/Cocktail-Shaker.git


Structure of cocktail-shaker
============================

Currently, the main subpackages are:

-   **megladon**: starcraft 2 main ai package 

Genesis
=======

Megladon has started because I needed projects away from life sciences.
